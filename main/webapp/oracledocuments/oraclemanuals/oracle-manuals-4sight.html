<h2>4 Sight</h2>
<p>4Sight is part of the new BAT 4Suite Innovation Toolkit. The methodology has been designed to test early stage innovative concepts and to provide a volumetric forecast to support the decision to invest to further development and move to the commercial stage, including machinery Capex and any significant use of resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4Suite is a quantitative toolkit and it is coupled with a qualitative Ethnography toolkit &ldquo;4Real&rdquo; and its 3 methodologies. &nbsp;4Sight tool is often accompanied by the 4Real Rituals tool to enrich the understanding on how the concept performs in real life use. Please refer to the 4Real manual for more information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key business question that 4Sight helps to answer:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Is the potential size of this innovation large enough to justify the Capex investment?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>4Sight will provide as an outcome an indicative Share Range that can be used as an input for the financial business case.</p>
<p>The tool includes also a number of indicators that will help us to understand the appeal and any potential issues with the concept.</p>
<p>4Sight is mandatory for Cap3 innovations and optional for Cap2 innovations. 4Sight should not be used for the Cap1 roll-out launches or testing potential for existing products. The main focus of the methodology is in providing early stage potential indicators.</p>
