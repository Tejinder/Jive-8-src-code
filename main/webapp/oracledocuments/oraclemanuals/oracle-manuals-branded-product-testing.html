<h2>Branded Product Testing (BPT) and Brand Monitor</h2>
<p>BAT has traditionally conducted majority of product testing in un-branded blind format &ndash; however this testing is best suited to test the pure product performance in isolated context. When consumers interact with products in the marketplace this happens always in branded format and in a total offer setting where the taste is likely to be influenced by branding factors.</p>
<p>With BAT&rsquo;s focus into differentiated blends, unique product experiences and the desire to understand the holistic product and quality experience there was a clear need to develop a branded product test into our methodology portfolio.</p>
<p>The Branded Product Test (BPT) will enable us to test our product performance in the real life environment in order to get a good understanding on the quality of the products and their impact on Brand Equity. It allows us to test the holistic product experience including any innovative features and concepts.</p>
<p>There are also cases where it is not possible to mask the products to conduct an un-branded blind test &ndash; typically we have these issues with Menthol products and with products that have very specific tipping or filter design. For such situations the Branded Product Test offers a way of testing the products and understanding our performance against the competitors.</p>
<p>Branded Product Testing will be used in two different ways within BAT:</p>
<p>1) <strong>Brand Monitor Programme</strong> &ndash; a replacement for the previous MASQ programme - a list of brands that are tested on yearly basis against competitor benchmarks in branded format. This is an on-going monitoring initiative and the results will trigger product improvement projects.</p>
<p>2) <strong>Ad-Hoc testing</strong> &ndash; as part of the product/prototype development programme the BPT can be used to test new prototypes. Both are based on the same underlying methodology and will contribute to the new Branded Product Test Normative Database. For details - please see the attached manual and questionnaires.</p>
