<td>Not Mandatory, but if method is to be conducted, it should be applied as described in this database.<br /><br /><strong>Overview<br /></strong><br />ORACLE Psychophysical Analysis method (PPA) is based on the evaluation of several products with varying levels of one attribute to assess ideal attribute levels. It provides actionable data for product development/manufacturing quality control, since consumer requirements can be linked to absolute levels of the attribute in question.<br /><br />Psychophysical Analysis (PPA) is one of the two methods of Product Physical Evaluation alongside Consumer Physical Quality Evaluation (CPQE). Please see the attached document for further Methodology information.<br /><br /><strong>Objectives<br /><br /></strong>The method provides:<br /><br />
<ul class="options">
<li>Consumer ideal level requirement for each product quality attribute.</li>
<li>Consumer acceptable range of variability around the ideal point (tolerance range).</li>
<li>Quantification of potential loss of consumer franchise in the event of a product attribute falling outside of the tolerance range to any given degree.</li>
</ul>
