<td>CSM has now been replaced by the new Customer Voice Methodology.<br /><br />The Customer Voice research programme has been designed to support Trade Marketing &amp; Distribution's mission &ldquo;to excite shoppers to buy and customers to sell our brands&rdquo; and place the retail customer at the heart of BAT&rsquo;s strategy.<br /><br />In the ever challenging environment, it is vital that we are addressing our customers and their needs and the only way we ensure we are doing this is by talking to them.<br /><br />The Customer Voice programme has been redesigned and developed &ndash; versus Customer Satisfaction Measurement Survey - to provide an in-depth understanding of BAT&rsquo;s customers whilst maintaining an (optional) quantitative measurement of key metrics.<br /><br />The qualitative nature of this research provides an opportunity to conduct an on-going dialogue with our customers in order to understand their issues and concerns in the changing retail environment, their thinking on the tobacco industry, and the quality of our activity. Through the discussion, we will identify opportunities from the customer's point of view as to how to collaborate better. The optional quantitative element will provide a point in time measurement of BAT&rsquo;s performance on key indicators, and allow changes in that performance to be tracked over time.<br /><br />Specific benefits are that the programme will:<br />
<ul class="options">
<li>Create a channel for retail customers to provide feedback and for BAT to act upon.</li>
<li>Assess the satisfaction and relevancy of service provided by BAT</li>
<li>Identify areas of opportunity and of lower performance, which can potentially be followed up with further monitoring and communication with retailers in any relevant End Market.</li>
<li>Encourage and drive End Market action planning with multi-function collaboration.</li>
</ul>
