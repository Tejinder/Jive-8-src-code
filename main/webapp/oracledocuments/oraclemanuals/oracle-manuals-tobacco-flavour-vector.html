<h2>Tobacco and Flavour Vector</h2>
<p>With the end goal of developing innovative products and differentiated brands, BAT has begun moving towards a more consumer centric, forward thinking and globally integrated business model. This vision centres on delighting consumers with differentiated product experiences.</p>
<p>In this light understanding the consumer preferences for products, tastes and flavours becomes critical. The Tobacco Vector Resonance Test has been developed as a new strategic tool to identify the potential taste territories &amp; blending opportunities in the markets.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Vector Resonance Test is designed to test the 12 taste exemplars developed by the Global leaf and blending team. Please note that TVR does not test current products in the market but is specifically designed for these special samples.</p>
<p>The 12 exemplars represent all the different tobacco types that BAT is currently using for blending. Understanding the taste preferences in a given market will help the product developers to design blends that are suited to consumer tastes and to identify new opportunities.</p>
<p>The Tobacco Vector Resonance Test (TVR) will use these 12 differentiated taste signatures to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uncover promising taste territories to inspire (differentiated) product development</li>
<li>Quantify share of lovers</li>
<li>Enable blend &amp; flavor signature development</li>
<li>Understand vectors in the context of consumer moments</li>
</ol>
