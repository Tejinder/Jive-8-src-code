<h2>Un-Branded Product testing (UPT) and Product Monitor</h2>
<p>Traditionally BAT has done most of the product testing in the un-branded format in order to understand the actual product performance without the impact of branding. With the new focus on product and developing differentiated and innovative products &ndash; BAT has revamped the product testing toolkit to include a wider range of tools both for un-branded and also branded product testing. The new toolkit will ensure that we have a comprehensive set of methods to do both strategic and tactical product testing for all the different types of products available.</p>
<p>The Un-branded Product Test (UPT) is an upgraded version of the previous CPT/MASQ/PSM methodology that BAT has used for the past 20 years. UPT has a rich set of Sensory Attributes specifically designed to suit a wide range of product types and it incorporates some new analytics to help us understand the performance of the differentiated and innovative products.</p>
<p>UPT replaces the previous CPT and PSM methods. The earlier MASQ testing is replaced by a Branded Product Test (BPT) and specifically the Brand Monitor.</p>
<p>The UPT will have two main uses within BAT:</p>
<p>1) Ad-Hoc testing &ndash; any new BAT blends should first undergo the un-branded testing to understand the pure product performance and standing against the norms. All Ad-Hoc UPT tests will contribute to the Product Database. Ad-Hoc testing is mainly used for testing new BAT prototypes against current BAT products and competitor benchmarks. The most common objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Launch</strong>&ndash; <em>to find out if the tested prototype achieves required performance against a set benchmark</em></li>
<li><strong>Product Improvement, re-Launch</strong> &ndash; <em>to find out if test product is superior to the current product on required parameters</em></li>
<li><strong>Product Rationalisation</strong> &ndash; <em>to ensure that a change in the product does not lead to erosion of product performance</em></li>
</ul>
<p>2) <strong>Product Monitor Programme</strong> &ndash;replaces the earlier PSM testing and also introduces a programme where every 3 years (or when necessary if there are significant changes in the market place) we test un-branded a larger set of competitor and BAT products to update norms in our product database.</p>
