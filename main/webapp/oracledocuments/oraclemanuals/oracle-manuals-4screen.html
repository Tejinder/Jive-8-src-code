<h2 class="main-header">4 Screen</h2>
<div class="description">
<p>4Screen is the first part of the BAT 4Suite Innovation Testing toolkit. The tool has been designed to screen and prioritise early stage ideas and concepts to help decide which ones are worth taking forward to the concept development stage.</p>
<p>4Screen can be used to test either early stage ideas or concepts &ndash; the type of test will need to be decided in advance:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early stage ideas</strong> &ndash; Unbranded and &ldquo;un-priced&rdquo; ideas that include an insight, benefit (claim) and a product description.</li>
<li><strong>Early stage concepts</strong> &ndash; Branded concepts. In addition to an insight, benefit (claim) and product description they include a reason to believe, a tagline, a price and an image or illustration of the concept.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key business question that 4Screen helps to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What are the most promising early stage innovation ideas or concepts i.e. whether the idea/concept is good enough to justify taking it forward to the next stage of the innovation process</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>4Screen uses standardised metrics to determine whether an early stage idea or concept should be dropped, de-prioritised, refined or progressed to the next innovation stage. 4Screen is a screening tool that will provide key metrics and diagnostics but no volumetric projection. The focus is on screening/ranking and comparing against a normative database. 4Screen is not suitable for testing more developed concepts or offers.</p>
