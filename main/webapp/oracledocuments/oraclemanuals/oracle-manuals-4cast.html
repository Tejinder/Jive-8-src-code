<h2>4 Cast</h2>
<p>4Cast is part of the new BAT 4Suite Innovation Testing toolkit. The methodology has been designed to validate the market share potential of a final offer (with all marketing mix elements complete and ready for launch) prior to taking final launch and resource allocation decision.</p>
<p>4Cast will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the final offer and a market share potential of the offer along with marketing mix diagnostics.</p>
<p>4Cast can be used with both a new brand /offer or with a re-launch and marketing mix change of an existing offer. This tool replaces the earlier Simulated Test Market (STM).</p>
<p>The key business question that 4Cast helps to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Is the potential market share of this offer after 12 months of the launch large enough to justify the launch and investment of resources?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>4Cast estimates the potential of the offer by providing a robust volumetric share potential projection as well as mix elements diagnostics to understand what is driving or hindering the potential.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coordinating agency for all the 4Cast studies is IMRB International. For more information please refer to the 4Cast Manual and Questionnaire:</p>
