<p>Deep Blue+ is a pricing research tool to forecast brand shares and movements due to any price change. However, the possible usage of Deep Blue+ is much beyond the area of pricing research. It is a suite of market research tool to help BAT end markets to take strategic pricing decisions through portfolio profit optimisation and provides a platform to explore</p>
<p>1. Deep Blue+ enables the BAT End Market to take informed pricing decisions for its current portfolio of offers in isolation or in the competitive context.</p>
<p>The key purposes of Deep Blue+ as a price forecasting tool are to:</p>
<ul class="options">
<li>Determine price elasticity of different brands</li>
<li>Predict brand share movements for current offers, cannibalisation and share of draw</li>
<li>Evaluate different possible pricing scenarios and their impact on brand share</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Deep Blue+ enables the business to identify pricing scenarios that could optimise BAT&rsquo;s portfolio position through volume, revenue or profit maximization, either individually or in any combination, taking into account competitor response.</p>
<p>This may be achieved through analysing consumers&rsquo; value assessment of the current offerings in the market and by checking if there is any scope for altering the current portfolio pricing to optimise portfolio position under given constraints.</p>
<p>3. Deep Blue+ enhances the framework of consumer value based pricing through evaluation of differentiated feature based innovations among target consumers. It principally tries to achieve the following:</p>
<ul class="options">
<li>Estimate consumer delight, i.e. the premium consumers are willing to pay over and above the current price of a brand for differentiated features</li>
<li>Decide on optimum price for these new feature based innovative offers</li>
<li>Prioritise among different feature based innovations</li>
</ul>
<p>Deep Blue+ exercise is not restricted to cigarette category alone. It can also be employed for similar understanding of price related behaviour for other smoking tobacco products like RYO, MYO, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Governance</strong></p>
<p>Deep Blue + falls under the governance of the Kantar Strategic Research Hub in India. All Deep Blue + studies are coordinated and analyzed by the specialist team. If you are conducting a Deep Blue + survey - your local Kantar coordinator should contact the Strategic Research Hub to discuss the specs and to obtain a quotation.</p>
<p>Deep Blue + is BAT Proprietary Methodology that uses Choice Based Modelling. It is not to be mixed up with the CBC product sold by other research agencies.
