<td>The General Consumer Survey (GCS) is the primary market tracking tool that BAT uses. It collects information used to monitor the development of the tobacco categories as well as BAT performance against competition.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since 2010 GCS runs under a global umbrella whereby the frequency, sample size and setup as well as the questionnaire are governed by the Global GCS Team comprising of a team within Kantar + BAT Global Oracle Manager. The Global GCS team is responsible for ensuring that the survey is conducted within the set standards and timings and provides high quality data for market tracking. The survey setup and questionnaire in each market for each wave has to be signed off by the Global GCS Team before the fieldwork can be started. The heart of the operations is the Global GCS Hub in India.<br /><br />Typically the frequency for GCS varies between quarterly and twice per year. GCS is a mandatory Common Platform survey for all T40 markets and is additionally governed by the Global Questionnaire and guidelines set by Global GCS Team each year.<br /><br />The GCS results are viewed with Batprobe software which is a mandatory part of the GCS setup. Likewise with the Batprobe software a set of rules govern the format of the template to ensure the global consistency and compliance.<br /><br />A set of local and above market reports are generated from the GCS survey for each wave. Global results will be shared across the Group after all T40 markets fieldwork is completed.<br /><br />GCS information areas include:<br />
<ul class="options">
<li>Monitoring of the tobacco category, incidence and tobacco products usage</li>
<li>Performance tracking of brands among relevant (target) segments using the Consumer Disposition</li>
<li>Funnel (CDF) Image Attributes evaluation across our GDB brands with consistent image attributes</li>
