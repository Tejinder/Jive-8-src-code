<h2>Oracle Segmentation</h2>
<p><strong>Consumer Segmentation</strong> is the new market segmenting tool that will replace the previously used Brand Values Segmentation (BVS). The new Segmentation methodology has been designed to be more forward looking and to treat the consumer holistically &ndash; not just as a smoker &ndash; to generate realistic and comprehensive market segmentation. &nbsp;This is a clear departure from the BVS that was strictly segmenting consumers based on their brand perceptions.</p>
<p>Broadly speaking the new segmentation will help to answer the following questions:</p>
<p><strong><em>1) What brand, product and innovation opportunities exist for our portfolio in a given market?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>2) How can we holistically understand consumers better to drive business growth?</em></strong></p>
<p>More specifically the segmentation will help us to answer questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the optimal mapping of our brand portfolio?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How do we position our brands to most resonate with consumers?</li>
<li>How do we best configure our offers?</li>
<li>Which opportunities should we prioritise to guide future innovations?</li>
</ul>
<p>Segmentation is a strategic tool which should underpin the portfolio strategy and activities in the market. It is recommended to be conducted every three years or after significant changes in the market which would have a strong impact on consumer behaviour, needs and expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coordinating agency for Consumer Segmentation is IMRB International&nbsp;</p>
