<h2>4 Tune</h2>
<p>4Tune is part of the new BAT 4Suite Innovation Testing toolkit. This tool has been designed as a late stage offer test to select the optimum mix combination and to finalise the launch manifesto. The tool prioritises mix element options based on offer potential and provides and overall assessment of the strength of the marketing mix. 4Tune can also be used to test changes to a single element of the mix (for instance packaging) and to test the strength of the proposed mix against the current or competitive offer.</p>
<p>The tool has two main designs answering the following key business questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What is the optimal offer mix for launch?</strong> &ndash; to be addressed through 4Tune Mix Optimiser</li>
<li><strong>What is the health of my mix for an existing offer in the market? </strong>&ndash; to be addressed through 4Tune Total Offer Dipstick</li>
</ol>
<p>The coordinating agency for 4Tune studies is IMRB International</p>
