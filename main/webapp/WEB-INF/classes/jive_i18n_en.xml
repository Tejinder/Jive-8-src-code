Hi <#if lastNameFirstNameEnabled>${user.firstName!?html}<#else>${user.name!?html}</#if>,

Thanks for joining ${SkinUtils.getCommunityName()}. We're looking forward to your contributions!

Here are some quick tips to help you get started:

Fill out your profile
 - Help the community get to know you. What are your hobbies?  Where did you grow up? Express your personality in the biography section.
 - Be sure to include any special skills or interests you have in the expertise field. That gives people another way to find and connect with you.
 - Don't forget to upload your profile picture and an avatar.

<#if (gettingStarted?exists && waterCooler?exists)>
Explore the community
 - The ${waterCooler.name} and the ${gettingStarted.name} spaces are a great place to start.
 - The ${waterCooler.name} is primarily for non-work related discussions.  Here's where you post about that cool weekend project, or discuss a favorite TV show.  Remember, you're broadcasting this information at work, so use your best judgment.
 - ${gettingStarted.name} is great if you just want to try out features on the site, like creating a sample document or discussion.

Start participating
 - Check out existing discussions to see what people are talking about. See a question you can answer? Post a response.  Or start an entirely new discussion.
 - If there's a document that you send via email constantly, post it to the community.

Welcome to Jive SBS.

Please use the following credentials<#if jiveURL?has_content > to log in at ${jiveURL}</#if>

username: ${newUserUsername}
password: ${password}

Before starting your exploration, there are a couple of concepts you should be familiar with:

1) Tagging - Jive SBS uses tags (which you might know as keywords or categories) extensively to provide rich metadata about discussions, documents and blog posts. It's not required that you use a tag or tags, but it's certainly helpful.

2) Discussions - Got a question or a problem?  Can't figure out how to install the latest version of widget xyz? Post a question to the community and let other team members do your work for you.

3) Documents - A document is an easy way to share information with your fellow team members. Use documents in place of Microsoft Word and you'll be happier at the end of the day. Remember that you can always roll back to a prior version of a document and that you can give permissions to other people to help you write a document.

4) Blogs - Got a blog but don't know how you'd use it? A blog is a great way of keeping co-workers and / or team members up to date with what you're working on. Think of your blog as a newsletter where you don't have to manage your subscribers and you can publish as often as you like.

Enjoy!]]>

Hi ${user.firstName!?html},

${SkinUtils.getDisplayName(relationshipView.user)} (${JiveResourceResolver.getJiveObjectEmailURL(relationshipView.user, true)}) is now following <#if (user.ID == relationshipView.person.ID)>your<#else>${SkinUtils.getDisplayName(relationshipView.person)}'s</#if> updates in ${SkinUtils.getCommunityName()} (${communityUrl}).
People who follow you can stay updated on what you're doing in the community. It's a great way to stay connected and to collaborate to get work done.
<#if !relationshipGraph.reflexive>
    <#if inverseRelationship>
        <#if (user.ID == relationshipView.person.ID)>
            Looks like you're already following ${relationshipView.user.firstName!?html} so you two will stay in sync with each other.
        <#else>
            ${SkinUtils.getDisplayName(relationshipView.person)} is also following ${SkinUtils.getDisplayName(relationshipView.user)}.
        </#if>
    <#else>
<#if (user.ID == relationshipView.person.ID)>
You can also follow ${SkinUtils.getDisplayName(relationshipView.user)} by clicking on the "Follow" button on their profile page: ${JiveResourceResolver.getJiveObjectEmailURL(relationshipView.user, true)}</#if>
