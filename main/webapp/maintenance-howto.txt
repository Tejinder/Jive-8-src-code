How to customize and upload custom maintenance page:

1. Firstly, having maintenance.html in the custom WAR has no effect.
2. If there are any images that need to be added, drop them in the same folder i.e web/src/main/webapp
3. Customize maintenance.html as needed
4. Use your favorite Zip tool to zip the images and html file together.
5. Upload the zip file in JCA by clicking Upload Maintenance page.
6. Don't forget to check into SVN :-)
